<p class="border border-success">Customers who are needing a mower for a week or for an extended amount of time can download mowers and set up an account with a valid email and password. The customer will then put in the address they would like mowed into our satellite database. Based off the address of the results from the customer will receive a quote for the yard mowed. The customer can then add extraâ€™s on to their package such as edging, leaf pick up, etc. Once the customer accepts the quote a mower who has gone through our rigorous background check will bring all the landscaping equipment and get the customers yard mowed, edged, etc. There is no monthly fee for customers, as well as no minimum requirements. Mowers will also offer a 10% discount to any customer who is a veteran, member of the armed forces, or healthcare worker.</p>



<p class="border border-success">Interested applicants must be 18 years or older to apply and must be able to pass a background check. Mowers will be responsible for transporting themselves and any equipment needed to perform the task to the designated address. Mowers will have the option of spending $49.99 USD a month to use the Mowers application or the mower could choose to give-up 20% of the mow pay. The choice is up to the mower, if the mower mows 10 yards for $35 a yard in a month. Then it would make sense for the mower to pay the $50 monthly service charge compared to spending the $70 in 20% fee.</p>
